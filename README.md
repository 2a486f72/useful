useful
===========

This is just a bag of useful small things that are used if various projects. The only purpose of this is to be able to maintain this functionality in one place, so any changes do not have to be copy-pasted around. Every piece of functionality in Useful is small and self-contained and does not have any great relationship to other pieces.

Feel free to use for whatever purpose. Contributions are welcome if they are aligned with the needs of projects where this library is currently being used.
